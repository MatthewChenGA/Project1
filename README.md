# Food Nutri-licious

## Project Purpose :

Project *Food Nutri-licious* will consist of a site that can help you retrieve information on certain food products. Utilizing the food API, you can reach out to all sorts of food stuffs. How much sugar per serving was used in the making of that particular can of preserved tomatoes? Look no further, this shall be your salvation.

### Current Features :

* Search bar to attempt to find product
* List out all related products
* A 'card' to randomly choose a product and calls the information

### Planned Features :

* Maybe a 'mini-game' where user guesses category of a random food
* Or clicking a category of foods to list out a set of products
* Sounds on clicks that resemble the item itself?# Project1
